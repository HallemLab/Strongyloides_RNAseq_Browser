### Source
The *S. papillosus* data included in this repository was originally analyzed by [Hunt *et al* 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3495). Raw reads were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive - study accession number [PRJEB14543](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB14543).  

### Samples

This dataset consists of 10 samples, representing 5 life stages with 2 biological replicates per life stage:

-   Free-living adult females (FLF)
-   Parasitic adult females (PF)
-   Infective third-stage larvae (iL3)
-   Free-living adult males (FLM)
-   Mixed population of 1st and 2nd stage larvae (L1/L2)

Note: samples included in this database were collected in two separate experiments, with FLM and iL3s in one, and FLF and PF in another. Due to the lack of sample overlap between the experiments, we do not correct for batch effects.
