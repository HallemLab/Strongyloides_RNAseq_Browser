The *S. stercoralis* datasets included in the *Strongyloides* RNA-seq Browser were originally

### Samples

These datasets consist of 24 samples, representing 8 life stages with 3
biological replicates for each life stage:

-   Free-living adult females (FLF)
-   Free-living adult males (FLM)
-   Parasitic adult females (PF)
-   Infective third-stage larvae (iL3)
-   Activated iL3s (iL3a)
-   Post-parasitic 1st stage larvae (ppL1)
-   Post-parasitic 3rd stage larvae (ppL3)
-   Post-free-living 1st stage larvae (pfL1)

Note: samples included in this database were sequenced in two separate runs, with FLM in one, and all other samples in another. However, the libraries were constructed at the same time and were sequenced using the same chemistry/equipment, just at an earlier date. Thus, batch effects should be minimal (see [Gonzalez Akimori *et al* 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87478-3)).
