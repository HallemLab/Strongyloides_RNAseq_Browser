### Source

The *S. ratti* data included in the *Strongyloides* RNA-seq Browser was originally published
by [Hunt *et al* 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3495). Raw
reads were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive - study
accession numbers
[PRJEB1376](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB1376) and
[PRJEB3187](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB3187).

### Samples

This dataset consists of 14 samples, representing 4 life stages with a
mixed number of biological and techincal replicates:

-   Free-living adult females (FLF): 3 biological replicates with 3
    techincal replicates for each biological replicate.
-   Parasitic adult females (PF): 3 biological replicates with 3
    techincal replicates for each biological replicate.
-   Infective third-stage larvae (iL3): 1 biological replicate
-   Free-living adult males (FLM): 1 biological replicate

Note: samples included in this database were collected in two separate
experiments, with FLM and iL3s in one, and FLF and PF in another. Due to
the lack of sample overlap between the experiments, we do not correct
for batch effects.
